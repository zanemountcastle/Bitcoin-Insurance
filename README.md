This is a side project based upon a paper written by Dan Mountcastle.

The paper develops a technique for pricing insurance for Bitcoins. In order to maximize the potential for the cryptocurrency in developing countries, a technique must be developed that protects individuals from the volatility of the cryptocurrency. This major disadvantage of Bitcoin prohibits impoverished individuals from investing heavily.

This paper and script are moves towards a solution to this problem. The insurance rates can be calculated to protect individuals from major decreases in the worth of Bitcoin.
